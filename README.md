If you have python and the packages you are good to go. Load up New World on your MAIN monitor (Only applicable for people with multiple monitors), enter the game and walk to your favorite fishing spot, set up your rod with bait, and do the following.

1. (Windows Users) Open up either `PowerShell` or `Command Prompt`. This can be done by pressing the Windows Key and searching for one of those applications:

2. Type `cd ` (make sure you add the space after the cd or else I will call you a monkey)

3. Drag and drop the folder that has the bot code onto the terminal

4. Press the enter key

5. Type `python main.py`, press enter and that is it!
